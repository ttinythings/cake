> Easy and fun to use query builder written in Reason. Inspired by [knex.js](http://knexjs.org/)

## What and Why?
Reason community needs a non-verbose, easy to use, modular query builder. This project aims to fill that void but for now, it is experimental.

To Do:
- [ ] Full Test Coverage
- [ ] Raw support
- [ ] Query execution functionality
- [ ] Multiple database support (adapters)
- [ ] Type safe query builder generation from schema
- [ ] Compile time query generation and validation (if possible)
- [ ] Reason Native Support
